*   **Day 5: Alpine.js (Core Concepts)**
    *   **Goal:** Add basic interactivity to your pages without complex JavaScript.
    *   **Topics:** Installing Alpine.js, `x-data` for component state, `x-init` for initial setup, `x-text` and `x-bind` for dynamic content, and `x-on` for handling events (clicks).

*   **Day 6: Livewire (First Component & Basics)**
    *   **Goal:** Create your first dynamic Livewire component.
    *   **Topics:** Installing Livewire, creating a Livewire component, `render` method, public properties, binding data with `wire:model`, and simple actions with `wire:click`.

*   **Day 7: Livewire (More Interactivity & Data)**
    *   **Goal:** Make your Livewire components more robust.
    *   **Topics:** Calling methods on your Livewire component, handling form submissions, basic validation, and displaying user feedback.

## Week 2: Advanced & Project

This week builds on your foundational knowledge, integrating the stack, and then applying everything to a project.

*   **Day 8: Livewire (Advanced Features)**
    *   **Goal:** Dive into more powerful Livewire features.
    *   **Topics:** Nesting Livewire components, component lifecycle hooks (`mount`, `updated`), component communication using events (`$emit`, `listeners`), and simple file uploads.

*   **Day 9: TALL Stack Integration**
    *   **Goal:** See how Tailwind, Alpine, and Livewire work together seamlessly.
    *   **Topics:** Using Alpine.js for transient UI states (modal, dropdown) while Livewire handles backend data. Styling everything with Tailwind.

*   **Day 10: Project Planning & Database Setup**
    *   **Goal:** Define your project and get the backend ready.

*   **Day 11: Project Development (Core Features)**
    *   **Goal:** Build the main functionalities of your project.
    *   **Topics:** Implement primary Livewire components (CRUD operations for tasks/posts). Apply Tailwind CSS for layout and styling.

*   **Day 12: Project Development (Enhancements)**
    *   **Goal:** Add more features and improve the user experience.
    *   **Topics:** Incorporate search, filtering, or pagination with Livewire. Use Alpine.js for dynamic UI elements (confirmation dialogs, tabs).

*   **Day 13: Project Development (Refinement & Edge Cases)**
    *   **Goal:** Polish your project and consider real-world scenarios.
    *   **Topics:** Implement user feedback (loading states, success/error messages). Briefly touch on basic authentication/authorization if applicable.

*   **Day 14: Project Completion & Review**
